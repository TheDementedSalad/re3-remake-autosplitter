# Instructions

Edit your splits and change the game name to "Resident Evil 3". A message should display below "Start Timer at:" that notifies you that auto splitting and IGT is available by CursedToast. Click the "Activate" button.

After activating the RE3 autosplitter, click "Settings". Place a checkmark next to every split you want to use.

Afterwards, create your splits/segments. Name them anything you want (just make sure you have one split for each checkmarked autosplit setting). Order them however you'd like.

Make sure you compare against Game Time in Livesplit by right clicking, "Compare Against -> Game Time".

Any problems? Reach out to me.

# I have a split request?

Great, reach out to me through the RE Speedrunning discord, and I'll see what I can do.

# Something didn't split or split at the wrong time.

Make sure you have the split checkmarked as explained above. If that doesn't work, or if a split of yours split at the wrong time, contact me.
